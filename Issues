1) Unable to deploy codedeploy agent on ec2 ubuntu 16.04
  - Realted Thread https://github.com/aws/aws-codedeploy-agent/issues/61
  -******Point to note******: 
  - Considering that maintenance for Ruby 2.0 ended in February 2016, 
  CodeDeploy is now relying on an unmaintained version. It was advised well over a year ago to move 
  all Ruby 2.0 projects to a newer version.
